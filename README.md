# Drug-Addicts-Detection-using-Facial-Cues
Addiction rates are increasing worldwide, bringing serious health and social consequences. Recent studies have shown that certain facial characteristics can serve as indicators, or biomarkers, of addiction. This opens up an opportunity for AI and ML models to play a key role- offering a solution that's lightweight, portable, and easy to deploy for early detection.
This project explores AI-driven early detection of drug addiction using facial image analysis. Traditional methods are slow and intrusive, prompting the use of deep learning for rapid, non-invasive screening. Using a balanced Kaggle dataset (560 images), we built two models: a custom CNN and a VGG16-based transfer learning classifier. Preprocessing included resizing and real-time augmentation. Trained in Keras and deployed via Gradio, the best model achieved 68% test accuracy showing moderate potential. Future work will focus on improving data quality, model architecture, and regularization techniques.
